--  Notes on messages 
 - ecm, repair, evasive: message to all players
 - spy goes to all players if in shared intel mode
 - fire target/player only, sink/defeat to all
 - victory should be reversed
 - lack of history renders most messages pointless, history would render ecm useless
 - make history list and have ecm wipe history list?
