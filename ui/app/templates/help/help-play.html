                <p>The screen is broken into four main areas.</p>

                <p>At the top is the summary of basic state of the game - who's turn it is, or who won
                    the game and messages from the last play.</p>

                <p>Along the left are the players of this game, whether they are alive or dead and their
                    scores.</p>

                <p>Below that, if it is your turn to play, are the available actions you can take based
                    on moves left and whether you are attacking or defending. Also, this is where you
                    can surrender or start rematches.</p>

                <p>Finally, the main part of the screen shows a grid of yourself or your opponent as
                    chosen.</p>
            </div>

                <p>Pick your opponent or yourself on the left. The available actions will appear under the
                    opponents. The chosen player will be highlighted.</p>

                <p><strong>Picking an opponent.</strong></p>

                <p>To defend, click 'Their view of you.' above the grid. This will show what your opponent can see.
                    Highlight the spot you want to defend. Then pick the action you want to take on the left under
                    the opponents.</p>

                <p>The attack, click 'Your view of them.' above the gird. This will show your view of their
                    sea so far. If they are not already defeated, you can click the cell you wish to attack
                    and the choice of attack on the left.</p>

                <p><strong>Picking yourself.</strong></p>

                <p>This will show you a consolidated view of what your combined opponents can see. Depending
                    on game options, not every player may see the same view. You can click on each player to
                    see their specific view.</p>

                <p><strong>Grid Highlights</strong></p>

                <p>When you pick a spot on the grid, it will be highlighted like <img
                        ng-src="images/{{main.theme}}/highlight.png"/>. Additional cells will be highlighted to show
                    what
                    will be shown or hidden if you use Spy or ECM like <img
                            ng-src="images/{{main.theme}}/extendedhighlight.png"/>. Also, if you are selecting a
                    cell
                    with your own ship, it will be highlighted as well to show which ship will take Evasive
                    Maneuvers or make Emergency Repairs.
