                    <p>This is where you place your own ships. Once you are happy, press Save.</p>

                    <p>The game begins when all players have saved their ships. As long as not all players
                        have saved their setup, you can keep moving your ships even after pressing Save.</p>

                    <p>But move quickly since there is no guarantee the other players won't finish soon!</p>

                    <p>You can drag and drop your ships into position. The ship you are moving will turn
                        <span class="greenShip">green</span> while you are moving it. Ships cannot be placed
                        on top of each other or out of bounds.</p>

                    <p>Double clicking or double tapping a ship will rotate it 90 degrees.</p>

                    <p>If ships are <span class="redShip">red</span>, it means they are on top of each other
                        and at least one needs to be moved.</p>
